5 A.M

Special moments (special moments, special moments, special moments)
Just watch my soul glow and see it shine true
Just watch my soul glow, baby
Feeling oh so sexy cool (oh yeah)

Just watch my soul glow, baby

Eso: Yeah I'm feeling sexy
Eso: Ladies and gentlemen, you've reached the 1-800 Love Line
Gary: Oh, just feeling a bit lonely at home, you know?
Eso: No need to feel lonely Gary, Soul Glow is going to sweep you off your feet and pour a bag of sugar on your nuts
Gary: Oho, that sounds pretty good
Eso: It's better than great Gary, it's Soul Glow. And for all you lovers out there, we got a special song coming your way

Just watch my soul glow, baby (oh yeah)
Just watch my soul glow
Cause me and the boys are gonna have a boogie
Now, where's my dancing socks
